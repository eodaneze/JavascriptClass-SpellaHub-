An API, or Application Programming Interface, is like a bridge that allows two different software systems to communicate with each other

Some of the popular types of APIs include:

RESTful APIs: These are widely used for simple data retrieval and manipulation. They use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Third-Party APIs: Many online services offer APIs that allow you to access their data, such as the Twitter API for tweets or the Google Maps API for location data.

Weather APIs: If you need weather data, APIs like OpenWeatherMap or the WeatherAPI are good choices.

Financial APIs: To fetch financial data like stock prices, you can use APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance.
